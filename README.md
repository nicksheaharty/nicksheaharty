# Hi there 👋 I'm Nick Harty

**Healthtech Innovator & Feel-Good Filmmaker | Founder @ [Medibound](https://medibound.com) | EE & Healthcare Management @ UPenn/Wharton

## 🚀 What I’m Building
I’m the technical founder of **Medibound** — an **AI‑native healthcare cloud** that lets clinics launch **agentic monitoring workflows** in minutes.  
We connect BLE sensors, vitals monitors, and wearables; trigger HIPAA‑safe variables from real‑time data; integrate with EHRs; and automate care — **no code required**.  
Think *Firebase for AI healthcare* — variable‑driven, compliance‑ready, and built so clinics can **monitor more patients, triage faster, and act on what matters**.

🎥 Outside of Medibound, I’m also a filmmaker, directing short films like *[Live A+ Little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4JM38IOfnA)* that blend storytelling with technical craft.
